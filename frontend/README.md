## Installation

1) Install `npm` / `node`
2) Run `npm install` from the root of the this project (the frontend part)
3) Build the files to serve with `npx webpack` (you may need to add the nodejs folder to your path if npx is not found)

You're done. The files are served from the backend server. As long as the backend is running you can see the frontend on localhost:8080

While developing, I recommend running `npx webpack --mode development --watch` and leaving that running.
