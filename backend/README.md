# Gorilla Groove

## Installation

Copy `/config/application.properties.cfg` to `/config/application.properties`. 

Environment specific setup will go in here. Some items in that file will need to be configured for the server to run successfully.

### Database
Gorilla Groove uses MySQL, and is always intended to run on the latest version. Right now that is MySQL 8.

Create a database called "groovatron"

Edit `/config/application.properties` and set `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` to be a MySQL user with access to the new `groovatron` database

If your MySQL is running on localhost with port 3306, then you are done. If it isn't, edit `spring.datasource.url` to be accurate for your database's IP and port

### FFmpeg

FFmpeg is used to convert files to OGG format. It will need to be installed from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html. If given a choice, install the "full" release build.
Once installed, edit `/config/application.properties` and setup `spring.data.ffmpeg.binary.location` to be the location to the FFmpeg binaries.

### YouTube Downloader

Importing songs from YouTube uses youtube-dl. Go to their website and download the latest executable. Put it in an appropriate location on your hard drive (the default is `C:\Program Files\YT Downloader\`, if you need some inspiration), then edit `/config/application.properties` and setup `spring.data.youtubedl.binary.location` to be the location of the YT Downloader executable.

## Running

If using Java 10, add `--add-modules java.xml.bind` to the JVM arguments, or you will see a ClassNotFoundException for JAXB

When the project starts up, it will use Flyway to migrate the database to the latest version.

### User Accounts

User accounts are invite only, and the first user has to be created by hand in the DB
By default the migrations add a user with the email "dude@dude.dude" and the password "dude"

You may, however, add your own user. 
The first way is to add it directly to the `user` DB table. The password will need to be encoded with BCrypt

However, it is recommended to log in with the "dude" user and create any additional users through the UI

(See the README in the UI directory for how to set it up)

### Logging in and sending requests
With the user created (or the default user), authenticate by sending a POST to:

`http://localhost:8080/api/authentication/login`

using the POST body
```$xslt
{ 
  "email": "the@best.email",
  "password": "plaintext-is-the-best"
}
```

This will return a UUID as an authentication token. You can then access authenticated resources by using the Authorization header like so:
```
Authorization: Bearer e9bedd3a-f476-46d9-aa31-92729342a3c3
```

Or setting this as a cookie with the name "cookieToken" and the value "e9bedd3a-f476-46d9-aa31-92729342a3c3"
